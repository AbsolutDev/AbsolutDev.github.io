              I am a self-taught <span class="blue">web developer</span> based in <span
                class="red">London</span>,<br />with a technical background and vast<br /><span
                class="blue">Project</span> and <span class="blue">IT Service Management</span> experience
            </div>

        </div>
        <div id="page-about" class="page">
          <div class="about-paragraph"><span class="indent"></span>Originally from <span class="bigger80 blue">Bucharest, Romania</span>, my interest in web development started in the early 2000s playing around with <span class="bigger40 red">HTML4, CSS</span> and even a bit of <span class="bigger40 red">JavaScript</span>. However, I went on a completely different journey in 2003 when I joined a global company that offered me the right environment and opportunities to grow and develop into becoming an experienced <span class="bigger40 blue">IT professional</span>.</div>
          
          <div class="about-paragraph">Having had roles in various IT areas, from <span class="bigger40 red">Technical Consultancy</span> and <span class="bigger40 red">Business Analysis</span> to <span class="bigger40 red">Project</span> and <span class="bigger40 red">IT Service Management</span>, I had the chance to meet and work with wonderful people, successfully collaborating with stakeholders at any levels, from IT engineers to top team business managers.</div>
          
          <div class="about-paragraph">One of the roles I have accepted has required me to relocate to <span class="bigger80 blue">London</span>, where I currently live with my wife and 11 years old daughter.</div>
          
          <div class="about-paragraph">Fast forward to mid-2019, I have decided that after 15+ years it is time to move on, and so I have accepted voluntary redundancy. The COVID-19 pandemic put on hold my plans of returning to work. However, it gave me the chance to spend time homeschooling my daughter and also explore different areas in technology, from <span class="bigger40 red">cloud architecture</span> and <span class="bigger40 red">containerization</span>, to <span class="bigger40 red">network management</span> and the <span class="bigger40 red">Internet of Things</span>. This, together with the abundance of tools and courses available online nowadays, led me to rediscovering my passion for <span class="bigger80 red">coding</span> and for designing and creating things that have real purpose.</div>
          
          <div class="about-paragraph">
            I am quietly confident, naturally curious and detail-oriented, always striving to improve my skills and
            knowledge, taking it one step at a time. I love the process of coding things from scratch and bringing ideas
            to life on the computer, which is what excites me most about starting a career in <span class="bigger40 red">software development</span>.
          </div>
          <div class="about-paragraph">
            I have a customer-focused approach and have been recognized as a problem solver, one of my greatest
            strenghts being the ability to remain calm and focused even in pressing circumstances.
          </div>
          <div class="about-paragraph">
            While I value the <span class="bigger40 red">autonomy and focus</span> that come with working <span class="bigger40 red">independently</span>, I also thrive in <span class="bigger40 red">collaborative
            environment</span> and enjoy being part of <span class="bigger40 red">teams</span> of any size. I believe that effective teamwork is essential to
            achieving great results and I am always looking for ways to improve collaboration and communication within a
            team.
          </div>
          <div class="about-paragraph">
            When I am not in front of my laptop, you'll find me listening to music, watching a good movie, cooking,
            gardening, outside in a park with my daughter or exploring the cliffs in Cornwall.
          </div>
          <div class="about-paragraph">
            I am eager to apply my knowledge and experience as a Junior Front End Developer, and I am excited about the
            opportunity to join a team that shares my passion for software development. I am constantly seeking to
            expand my skillset and knowledge, with the goal of ultimately becoming a Full Stack Engineer or Team Lead.
