# Project Portfolio Website #

## Description ##

This is a website created as part of the [Codecademy Front-End Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path) programme, to put in practice the learnings from the first 15 modules.

## Skills Used ##
- HTML + CSS
- JavaScript
- Git + GitHub
- Command Line and File Navigation

## Technique ##

My approach was to create something that looks simple and minimalistic, yet has a bit of dynamism and touches all the technologies covered so far.

All content is present on a single page and divided in "divs" that are overlapping using "position: absolute" CSS property. The divs are hidden using transparency property and I've used z-index to obstruct the behaviour of the external hyperlinks that were coming through the layers.

The "links" in the navigation bar are just span elements with associated handlers for click, mouse over and mouse out events. When clicked, the current page is made transparent and the targetted page is made opaque - the transition being smoothed by CSS.

As for responsiveness, most content is positioned using flexbox layout and there are some rearrangements happening when the screen width goes below 900px and then again below 600px.

## Conclusion ##
To be completely honest I initially thought it's an easy job but had quite a few challenges mostly around positioning of elements. In the end it took me almost 4 days (have also redone almost everything half way through) to reach a stage that I find is ready for reviewing.  Have learned a lot and I love a challenge, so it's been a great experience!
